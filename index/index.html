 <p class="quote"><em>the site about the liquid gold known as coffee</em></p>
 <p>We at Vemarias virtual cafe have a compassionate mission, to make sure everyone gets the perfect
    sip of coffee each time, the more taste budsa we can save the better. Sometime coffee tastes like
    a bitter mess and when that was your first and only time making it you associate homemade coffee
    with bad experiences while hopping in a ride to the nearest starbucks to order some watered down 
    drinks.
